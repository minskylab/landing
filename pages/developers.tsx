                        At Minsky, we heavily think that we need to work with the community and promote open knowledge
                        for its. We think that way have a powerful tool to change and route our nation to a
                        technology-based future. We want to know more developers (and not) interested in use and enhance
                        this model {"-"}based on open source and community driven{"-"} following the only goal to change
                        the technology reality of Peru.
